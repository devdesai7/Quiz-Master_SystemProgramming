# Quiz-Master_SystemProgramming

System Programming Mini Project

Welcome to Quiz Master, Following Project explores the concept of System Programming in C
Language, where it communicates and works closely with the System and help the code to run more
efficiently. Following Project Includes Concepts of Make File, File IO (Buffered and Unbuffered),
Process Management ,IPC Signals, IPC Pipes, Inbuilt Header Files.

Goal of the Project is to Understand the Core Concepts of System Programming in C Language,
Following is done with the Example of Quiz Master which has functionalities such as:

• A Faculty can modify Quiz Properties (Delete/Rename)
• A Faculty can View Marks in a Group of Student for a given Subject.
• Student Take up the Quiz.
• Student can View his/her Marks.

Requirements of this Project is:
• GCC Compiler is required in order to execute the File
• The Folder Structure needs to Maintain the same Hierarchy.
• A Pre-Defined Subject List for which Quizzes can be made.

Assumption Made:
• There is 1 Faculty and N number of Students.
• There is a Pre-defined Subject List.
• Bin Has a MainFile which needs to Run in Order to Start the Program, and that Main File
Consists two other Program 1.For Faculty 2.For Student, on selection of user the following
File will be called upon.
